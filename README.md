# Zitate-Sammlung mit *jQuery Mobile (jQM)*

This repository contains a single HTML file in folder [docs/](docs/ ) which 
represents a tiny collection of computer science quotes.
In the HTML file we use the front-end framework  [jQuery Mobile (jQM)](http://jquerymobile.com) to realize
a *look & feel* similar to a mobile app with several pages or screens.
This HTML file could be put into a native app containter created by
[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) to get a so called *hybrid app* for Android and/or iOS.
